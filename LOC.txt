Much of the code in gui.ml does not count for our LOC, as it was taken from the 
book we cited in both gui.ml and gui.mli. We created gui.mli but added the 
citation for transparency.

We did have to modify the use of Bytes and added a function to change labels in 
gui.ml.

Our LOC are

1854 with nothing from gui
1869 with our original code from gui
2358 including gui
