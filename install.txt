Our program requires

-CamlImages, which can be installed using
   opam install CamlImages
   NOTE : You may need to update CamlImages, for instance using 
   opam upgrade. We use CamlImages.graphics, added in a recent update.
-Graphics, which can be installed using 
   opam install graphics.
   You will also need to be able to open an X11 window. With a Mac, this can be
   done through the xquartz instructions on canvas. With windows on WSL, this 
   can be accomplished by downloading a program called Xming, running it, and 
   typing 
   export DISPLAY=:0
   into the terminal.

Installation

1. Download and extract the files
2. Build the system. At the moment, the system is somewhat fragmented. Here are 
   some useful make commands: 
   -The command ``make fractal'' will build and start the main system,
   asking for input on relevant fields to construct a system
   -The command ``make mandelbrot'' will build and start a system that draws the
   mandelbrot set. Clicking on a point will draw the associated Julia set. 
   -The command ``make newton'' will give an example of a fractal created 
   through Newton's method
3. Whichever option you choose, perhaps after inputting information as 
   prompted, a graphical window will appear (assuming graphics is configured).
   You can now explore the fractal to your heart's content. At the moment, the
   following key bindings are implemented:
   q: quit the application. If this is used while looking at a Julia set from 
      make mandelbrot, pressing q once will bring you back to the mandelbrot set 
      and pressing q again will quit. 
   z: undo last action. If there are no actions to undo, quit the application
   y: redo last press of z. The action of leaving the window for a polynomial 
      during cannot be redone 
   e: double the number of iterations computed
   c: zoom in by a factor of 20, centered on current mouse position
   digits 1-9: zoom in by that factor, centered on current mouse position

 
4. Look at output
   -if make fractal is run, a .bmp image will appear in the current directory

Congratulations! You have generated your own fractal.
