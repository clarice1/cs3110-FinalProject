Our program requires

-CamlImages, which can be installed using
   opam install CamlImages

Installation

1. Download and extract the files
2. Build the system
   The command ``make fractal'' will build and start the system
3. Follow the instructions on the screen to input 
  -the desired name of the output file (do not put an extension, will be added as .bmp)
   -the coefficients for a polynomial. Here are some suggestions for interesting images:
     1 0 .25
     1 0 .27
     1 0 -.75
     1 0 1
     1 0 -1.5
   -the number of iterations you would like to iterate for (100 is usually sufficient to get good images. )
   -the width of the image (in pixels)
   -the height of the image (in pixels)
   -the lower left corner of the desired image (the real and complex parts, one after another, 
      -2-2i is sufficient for polynomials with small coefficients, included the recommended above)
   -the upper right corner of the desired image (the real and complex parts, one after another, 
      2+2i is sufficient for polynomials with small coefficients, included the recommended above)

 
4. Look at output
   -the image will be saved as file with the inputted name, with extension .bmp

Congratulations! You have generated your own fractal.
