Our program requires

-CamlImages, which can be installed using
   opam install CamlImages
   NOTE : You may need to update CamlImages, for instance using 
   opam upgrade. We use CamlImages.graphics, added in a recent update.
-Graphics, which can be installed using 
   opam install graphics.
   You will also need to be able to open an X11 window. With a Mac, this can be
   done through the xquartz instructions on canvas. With windows on WSL, this 
   can be accomplished by downloading a program called Xming, running it, and 
   typing 
   export DISPLAY=:0
   into the terminal.
